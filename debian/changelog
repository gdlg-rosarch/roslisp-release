ros-indigo-roslisp (1.9.10-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Removed directory asdf form install target.
  * Don't use rospack or the asdf subdirectory to find system load-manifest.
    Instead, we use the directory of the initfile directly, assuming that
    it's always in the roslisp directory.
  * Got rid of asdf subdirectory and symbolic links.
    As of asdf2, the symbolic links to asd files are not required anymore.
    They even screw up the deb build proces. Deleting them.
